# 🌳 Fractal Tree Drawing with Python Turtle

This Python script generates a **recursive fractal tree** using the `turtle` graphics module. It creates a natural tree-like structure with green branches and small orange leaves at the ends.

## 🌟 Features

- Recursive drawing of a binary tree structure
- Turtle graphics for visual fun
- Custom colors: **brown** trunk, **green** branches, and **orange** leaves
- Natural growth effect using angle-based recursion

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` (comes with standard Python installation)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `tree.py`.
3. Run it in your terminal or Python IDE:

```bash
python tree.py
